Go to 'server-side' directory. This is a work directory

The directory 'server-side/otapackage/customer/generated' contains pregenerated config files for M3K fw.

'partition_nand.conf' usually doesn't need to edit (it allready correspond to M3K nand partition scheme)

'customization_nand.conf' you can edit manually or generate it interactively with running 'customize.sh'
